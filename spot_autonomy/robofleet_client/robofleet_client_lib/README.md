# robofleet_client_lib
Shared library for C++ based robofleet clients

This shared library includes robofleet's messages scheduler, as well as starter code for the encoding and decoding libraries for sending messages across robofleet.

It has no dependencies outside of C++11, and can be included in a larger project to make a full-fledged robofleet client.

Please see https://github.com/ut-amrl/robofleet_client and https://github.com/ut-amrl/robofleet_base_client for examples of such extension
