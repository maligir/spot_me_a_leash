# this file is frontier exploration (this runs every time new map is generated)

# constantly read in the map
# done using nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid (subscribe to /map)
# use rospy to accommplish above (follow tutorial)

# repeat below steps with current map as the input

# find the frontiers
# with ocupancy grid check for borders with -1
# add all frontiers to frontier list (priority queue)
# closest frontier is at front of the list

# select frontier closest/farthest to robot (just pop from queue) that is not in visited set
# add new frontier to the visited set

# move robot to just a certain distance away from it - cmd_vel
# move robot to frontier - publish move_base/goal to move_base
# publish to move_base/goal to move_base
